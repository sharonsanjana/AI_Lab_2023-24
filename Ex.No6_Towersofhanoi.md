AIM:
To write a logic program to solve Towers of Hanoi problem using SWI-PROLOG.

Algorithm:
Start the program
Write a rules for finding solution of Towers of Hanoi in SWI-PROLOG.
a ) If only one disk => Move disk from X to Y.
b) If Number of disk greater than 0 then
   i)	Move  N-1 disks from X to Z.
   ii)	Move  Nth disk from X to Y
   iii)	Move  N-1 disks from Y to X.
Run the program to find answer of query.
Program:
move(1,X,Y,_) :-
 write('Move top disk from '),
 write(X),
 write(' to '),
 write(Y),
 nl.
move(N,X,Y,Z) :-
 N>1,
 M is N-1,
 move(M,X,Z,Y),
 move(1,X,Y,_),
 move(M,Z,Y,X).
Output:

Result:
Thus the solution of Towers of Hanoi problem was found by logic programming.
